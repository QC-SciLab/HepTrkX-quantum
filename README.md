CHEP 2019 proceeding is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08126

The scripts used to produce CHEP 2019 results is at results/QuantumEdgeNetwork.py

Notice that this is a project in progress. Latest results are produced using train.py and are different from the one in the proceeding.

*The repository has many scripts which are not complete! Work in Progress!*
